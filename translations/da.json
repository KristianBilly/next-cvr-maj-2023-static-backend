Regardless, you can expect to pay tax on the ATP payments. For many pensioners, the ATP pension can correspond to a significant increase in their state pension. In some cases, it can give a 30-40 percent increase to the state pension.",

Stocks with betas higher than 1.0 can be interpreted as more volatile than the S&P 500. Beta is used in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets (usually stocks).",
